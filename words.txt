bandit
“Music delights the ears, uplifts the mind, arouses fighters to go to war, strengthens the weak, and disarms bandits!”

dirge
We tear up at weddings and funerals, not at the sight of the beautiful bride or the draped casket, but when the wedding processional or the funeral dirge begins.

ominous
We get scared at horror films, not when the images become graphic, but when the music starts to get ominous.

four-note
Think of the four-note “rally motive” played on the loudspeaker at professional sports events to get the crowd and home team energized. 

piped in
the airlines don’t want Ludacris or Metallica piped in during flight delays.

symphonies
stereos
And did you know that the state of Arizona recently passed a law banning the playing of powerful Beethoven symphonies on car stereos because it make drivers to aggressive? (Not true, of course, but you get the point). 

profoundly
Sound perception is the most powerful sense we possess. A sudden noise can make us jump out of our seats. And organized sound—music—profoundly affects the way we feel and behave.

pitch
Sound waves radiate out in a circle from their source, carrying with them two types of essential information: pitch and loudness.

amplitude	wave	width	
The speed of vibration within the sound wave determines what we perceive as high and low pitches; and the width (or amplitude) of the wave reflects it volume. 

groove	pulse	synch
律动	节奏、节拍都是具体描述，律动是抽象概括
We tend to hear low, slow tones as relaxing, and high, rapid ones as tension filled. If the sound waves contain strong, regular pulses, we might start to tap our foot or move in synch with the pulse or beat—the groove.

vinyl
Sound recording began in the 1870s with Thomas Edison’s phonograph machine, which played what we now call “vinyl”, or records.

superseded 
During the 1930s magnetic tape recorders appeared and grew in popularity until the early 1990s, when they were superseded by a new technology, digital recording.

temporal lobe
Most processing of sounds (music as well as language) take place in the temporal lobe.

frontal lobe
If we are imagining how the next line of a song will go, that decision is usually reached in the frontal lobe. 

parietal lobe / occipital lobe
If we are playing an instrument, we engage the motor center (parietal lobe) to move our fingers and the visual center (occipital lobe) to read the notes. 

neuron
Associative neurons instantly integrate all the data into a single perception of sound.

amygdala 杏仁核 位于前颞叶背内侧部,海马体和侧脑室下角顶端稍前处。
How music makes us feel—happy or sad, energetic or relaxed—is determined partly by another part of the brain, the amygdala, and by other factors as well. 

dopamine
Neuroiologists have observed increased levels of the chemical dopamine in the brain when pleasing music is heard, just as when, say, we eat  chocolate.

melody
Have you ever heard an old melody suddenly pop into your head, or had a really annoying tune get stuck there?

hippocampus 海马体（大脑中被认为是感情和记忆中心的部分）
Of course; it happens to us all. Errant data coursing around the hippocampus may be to blame!

sonic / engrave
The songs we best remember are those from our adolescence, when hormonal changes caused sonic information to be engraved in our brain forever.

cull
Here are a few responses culled from a recent survey of one hundred college students.

resonate with
See if any of these answers resonate with your own experience.

Decompression.

clarify
It synthesizes and clarifies the emotion that I already feel inside myself.

commission a survey 
o find out, National Public Radio (NPR) recently commissioned a survey of regular listeners of classical music. 

majesty
Classical music provides a version of a better world, a refuge of beauty and majesty in which we pass beyond the limit of our material existence.

highlife	reggae
Some cultures also have their own native brand of popular music, such as highlife, which emerged in the 1990s in Ghana, West Africa, or the more recently reggae form Jamaica.
Highlife is a music genre that originated in Ghana early in the 20th century. 

conversatory
Today Western classical music is taught in conservatories in Beijing, Tokyo, and Singapore, and Western popular music, for good or for ill, has almost drowned out local popular music. 

foreground
In classical music, the rhythmic “beat” often rests beneath the surface. Popular music foregrounds a recurring, heavy beat.

contemporary
Popular music exists in the real world, its lyrics embracing such issues of contemporary life as
love and rejection, racism and social inequality.
