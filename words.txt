bandit
“Music delights the ears, uplifts the mind, arouses fighters to go to war, strengthens the weak, and disarms bandits!”

dirge
We tear up at weddings and funerals, not at the sight of the beautiful bride or the draped casket, but when the wedding processional or the funeral dirge begins.

ominous
We get scared at horror films, not when the images become graphic, but when the music starts to get ominous.

four-note
Think of the four-note “rally motive” played on the loudspeaker at professional sports events to get the crowd and home team energized. 

piped in
the airlines don’t want Ludacris or Metallica piped in during flight delays.

symphonies
stereos
And did you know that the state of Arizona recently passed a law banning the playing of powerful Beethoven symphonies on car stereos because it make drivers to aggressive? (Not true, of course, but you get the point). 

profoundly
Sound perception is the most powerful sense we possess. A sudden noise can make us jump out of our seats. And organized sound—music—profoundly affects the way we feel and behave.

pitch
Sound waves radiate out in a circle from their source, carrying with them two types of essential information: pitch and loudness.

amplitude	wave	width	
The speed of vibration within the sound wave determines what we perceive as high and low pitches; and the width (or amplitude) of the wave reflects it volume. 

groove	pulse	synch
律动	节奏、节拍都是具体描述，律动是抽象概括
We tend to hear low, slow tones as relaxing, and high, rapid ones as tension filled. If the sound waves contain strong, regular pulses, we might start to tap our foot or move in synch with the pulse or beat—the groove.

vinyl
Sound recording began in the 1870s with Thomas Edison’s phonograph machine, which played what we now call “vinyl”, or records.

superseded 
During the 1930s magnetic tape recorders appeared and grew in popularity until the early 1990s, when they were superseded by a new technology, digital recording.
